# This Package

This package provides a simple but effective LAN-wide, broadcast, server discovery mechanism for Unity Netcode for Gameobjects.

The package is a derivative work of the Unity [Netcode for GameObjects Extensions Network Discovery package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions/tree/main/com.community.netcode.extensions). The Unity Community Package was published by Unity under the MIT Licence and this package retains that licence.

It has been made into a standalone package and has been updated for more recent versions of Netcode for GameObjects.

The example code has been moved to a separate test project to avoid overstuffing this package and to keep things simple. See this project - which is what we use to test the package https://github.com/ViRGIS-Team/UD-Test-Project

# Installation

This is a UPM package and can be installed from the Github repository or from [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.community.netcode.networkdiscovery/)

# Port Ranges and Multiple Servers on the same IP address / machine

As of version 1.1.0, This package uses IP Port ranges.

The component asks for a Port Range Start (default 47770) and a Range Size (default 10).

When the server starts, it searches for a free port in the range (which in the default case is 47770 - 47779) and uses that port. This means that you can have multiple servers on the same IP address and the servers do NOT need to aware of each other, they just search for an unused port at the IP level.

The clients broadcast on ALL ports in the Port Range, to able to get responses from all servers.

If you want to retain the legacy behaviour, set the Port Range Start to the port you want and the Port Range size to 1. This will assign the port and will not check if the port is in use.

> Note: Currently this legacy setting (i.e. Port Range Size of 1) is the only mode supported on MacOS and Linux because of a bug in Mono.

# NetworkDiscovery

Network discovery allows clients to find active game servers in the same local area network without going through the hassle of figuring out the servers IP and passing it to other player.

Under the hood network discovery uses UDP broadcasts to send a broadcast to all devices on the LAN to which active servers will respond to.

> Note: Network discovery only works on LAN and might not work in some networks.

TBD => Tidy up the rest

## ExampleNetworkDiscovery & ExampleNetworkDiscoveryHud

The `ExampleNetworkDiscovery` class provides an example implementation for implementing network discovery.

To use the `ExampleNetworkDiscovery`:
1. add the `ExampleNetworkDiscovery` and the `ExampleNetworkDiscoveryHud` components to the GameObject which contains the `NetworkManager.
2. Run your application start a server or host. A "Stop Server Discovery" button should appear on the left side of the screen. This indicates that the server is discoverable. The button can be pressed to disable or enable the discovery of the server.
3. Run your application but don't start a client yet. On the left side of the screen a "Discover Servers" button should appear. Press that button and any servers which are discoverable will be listed. Press on one of those servers to join the server as a client.

## Writing your own network discovery

Take a look at `ExampleNetworkDiscovery` for how to write your own NetworkDiscovery. `DiscoveryBroadcastData` and `DiscoveryResponseData` can be filled with more information if needed on a case per case basis. For instance the server could include a number of current players in the response.
